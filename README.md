This project presents a Java-based Banking System designed to demonstrate clean architectural practices and the practical use of software design patterns. The system simulates core banking operations, including account management, deposits, withdrawals, transaction processing, interest calculation, and notifications, while emphasizing modularity, extensibility, and maintainability.

At the heart of the system is the BankFacade class, which acts as a unified entry point to all banking operations. This implementation of the Facade pattern simplifies interactions with the underlying services, allowing developers or users to work with a single interface rather than dealing with multiple classes directly.

The system also employs the Composite pattern through the accounts module, which allows individual accounts and groups of accounts to be treated uniformly. This enables the calculation of total balances for a group of accounts in the same way as for a single account, making the management of multiple accounts simpler and more flexible.

Interest calculation is implemented using the Strategy pattern, allowing the system to switch between different algorithms, such as simple or compound interest, at runtime without modifying existing account logic. This makes the system highly adaptable to changing business rules or new interest calculation methods.

Important system events, like deposits, withdrawals, or the creation of new accounts, are communicated to external services using the Observer pattern. For example, both email and SMS notifications are sent automatically when these events occur, demonstrating how the system can easily integrate with external monitoring or alerting mechanisms.

Transaction approval is handled through a Chain of Responsibility pattern, where small transactions may be automatically approved, while larger transactions are escalated to higher approval levels. This design ensures that transaction workflows are flexible and maintainable, and it mirrors real-world banking processes.

Additionally, the system uses the Decorator pattern to dynamically extend account functionality. For instance, FeeAccountDecorator allows the application of transaction fees without changing the original account classes. This pattern illustrates how responsibilities can be added at runtime in a reusable and non-intrusive way.

To run the system, a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher is required. All interactions with the banking system are performed through the BankFacade, and the project can be executed by running the Main class located in the banking_system package. Through this setup, the system demonstrates a well-structured, maintainable, and extensible approach to building a banking application using multiple design patterns effectively.
