# banking-system
This project implements a Java-based Banking System developed to demonstrate clean architectural design and the practical application of software design patterns. The system simulates core banking operations such as account management, deposits, withdrawals, transaction processing, interest calculation, and notifications, with an emphasis on modularity, extensibility, and maintainability.

Several design patterns are applied within the system to address different architectural concerns. The Facade pattern is used through the BankFacade class to provide a unified entry point for all banking operations. The Composite pattern is implemented in the accounts module to allow individual accounts and account groups to be treated uniformly. The Strategy pattern is used to enable flexible interest calculation algorithms that can be changed at runtime. The Observer pattern is applied to notify external services when important system events occur. The Chain of Responsibility pattern is used to manage transaction approval workflows through multiple approval levels.

To run the project, a Java Development Kit version 11 or higher is required. The system can be executed by running the Main class located in the banking_system package. All interactions with the system are performed through the BankFacade, which coordinates the underlying services and components.
